# GLAND: A Global and Local Attention‐Based Framework for Detecting Small and Non‐Continuous Spatial Domains

## Overview
[Placeholder: Add a brief description of GLAND here, e.g., "GLAND is a graph-based self-supervised contrastive learning framework designed for processing spatial transcriptomics data and identifying spatial domains with high precision."]

## Installation

We recommend using a Conda environment to manage dependencies. You can install the core requirements directly from the repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/CSUBioGroup/GLAND.git](https://github.com/CSUBioGroup/GLAND.git)
cd GLAND

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt```

For detailed instructions, including R environment configuration and GPU setup, please visit our [Installation Guide](https://gland.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
